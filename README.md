# Machine Learning from Scratch
My efforts to implement some basic machine learning algorithms from scratch in Python 
In this repository are the implementation of 15 basic algortihms and a neural network
1. K Nearest Neighbours
2. Linear Regression
3. Logistic Regression
4. Naive Bayes
5. Perceptron
6. SVM
7. Decision Tree
8. Random Forest
9. PCA
10. K-Means Clustering
11. AdaBoost
12. LDA
13. Simple Direct Neural Network
